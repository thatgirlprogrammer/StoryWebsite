Adaptive Climbers Festival
The annual, community-focused, three day event that gives opportunities for climbers with disabilities to climb, learn, and hang out in the great outdoors starts October 12th at the Red River Gorge in Kentucky. I am looking forward to camping, eating delicious food, meeting new climbers, hanging out with old friends, and of course climbing - a lot!
