Catalyst Sports Climbing and Camping weekend
 Catalyst Sports hosted a camping climbing weekend April 28-30 at Sandrock Alabama. The event was open to anyone with a physical disability and their family. I had just come off a big training weekend so I was ready to send some hard climbs. There were about 50 campers and my sister volunteered to cook for everyone.
