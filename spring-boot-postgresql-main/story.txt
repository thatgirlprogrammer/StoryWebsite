Southeast Paraclimbing Training Camp
 Catalyst Sports Adaptive Climbing Group, and Paracliffhangers hosted the first South East Training Camp at Triangle Rock Club in North Carolina from April 21-23. The weekend included a welcome community night followed by two intensive training days with coaches gearing us up for international competitions this summer. The camp was very well organized, informative, and as a result I believe Iâ€™ve increased my climbing expectations.
